# Node-SSA-app

This is the Self Sovereign Attendancy application.
Written for NodeJS as a PoC.

The code-dir has a JS-file for 4 modules:

- organiser.js
- attendee.js
- closeevent.js
- verifier.js

Information between the modules is shared through a JSON-file with minimal values.

It is all based upon IOTA-MAMchannels on the chrysalis-testnet. To be replaced with IOTA-Streams before final deployment.
